# RSA Factoring Challenge

This project demonstrates implementations of the RSA Factoring Challenge in Python. The challenge involves factorizing given numbers into products of smaller numbers, as well as factorizing RSA numbers into their prime factors.

## Getting Started

These scripts are designed to run on systems with Python installed. No additional dependencies are required.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/udeme-goc/RSA-Factoring-Challenge.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```sh
cd RSA-Factoring-Challenge
```

3. Run the scripts:
For the factors challenge:

```sh
./factors.py tests/test00
```

For the RSA challenge:

```sh
./rsa.py tests/rsa-1
```

## Usage
- The factors.py script takes a file containing natural numbers to factorize and outputs their factorizations.
- The rsa.py script takes a file containing RSA numbers to factorize and outputs their prime factorizations.
